# Parallel Data Processing Using MPI 

## Project Objective
- Build a web-based application enabling users to perform various parallel data processing tasks using MPI in Python.  
- Demonstrate how distributed computing accelerates common tasks by leveraging multiple processes.

---

## User Interface
- Select the type of parallel task to perform.  
- Upload files or input data as required.  
- Display results of MPI-based processing.

---

## Tasks to Implement (All using MPI)
1. **Sorting**  
   - Algorithm: Odd-Even Transposition Sort  
   - Input: List of numbers  
   - Output: Sorted list  
   - Compare performance between sequential and parallel execution.

2. **File Processing**  
   - Upload a `.txt` file  
   - Count total words and remove duplicates  
   - Output: Word count and number of unique words.

3. **Image Processing**  
   - Upload an image (`.png`, `.jpg`)  
   - Apply Grayscale or Blur filters  
   - Output: Display processed image.

4. **ML Training**  
   - Train a Linear Regression model  
   - Input: Numeric data in CSV format  
   - Output: Model coefficients and intercept.

5. **Parallel Search in Large Text**  
   - Algorithm: Parallel keyword search  
   - Input: Large `.txt` file and a keyword  
   - Output: Number of occurrences and their positions.

6. **Parallel Statistics Analyzer**  
   - Algorithm: Distributed statistical analysis  
   - Input: CSV file with numeric columns  
   - Output: Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max, Standard Deviation per column.

7. **Distributed Matrix Multiplication**  
   - Algorithm: Parallel matrix multiplication (block-wise row/column distribution)  
   - Input: Two compatible matrices (CSV or manual input)  
   - Output: Resultant multiplied matrix.

## Additional Features
- Option to select the number of MPI processes.  
- Display charts comparing sequential vs parallel performance (if feasible).  
- Calculate and show performance metrics.
